# The Cellular Landscape of Human White Adipose Tissue in Health and Metabolic Disease: a Meta Perspective

ABSTRACT
Adipose single-cell studies have uncovered important biological findings. However, most reports are based on small cohort sizes and there is no cellular consensus nomenclature of human white adipose tissue (WAT). Herein, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available and newly generated results from human WAT single-cell, single-nucleus, and spatial transcriptomic data. Our high-resolution map is based on 401,320  cells from three depots of 13 14  cohorts including 103 samples from 83 subjects and allowed us to robustly identify >60 subpopulations of adipocytes, fibroblast and adipogenic progenitors, vascular, and immune cells. Using these results, we deconvolved bulk transcriptomic data from eight independent cohorts (864 subjects) and identified associations between cell populations and body weight, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, fat cell volume, and lipolysis. Altogether, our meta-map of human subcutaneous, omental and perivascular WAT provides a rich resource that defines cell states and how they are affected by health and metabolic disease.
